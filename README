TITLE: Roundcube Webmail Change Password (OpenLDAP w/ Samba and Password Rules)

**************************************
Based on the password plugin that comes with .3 of roundcube

Modified the password.js to call Seven Levithan's password rules function.  
Rules are right there in password.js towards the bottom. 

Created a new Driver Class called alliance (we're using star wars themes at work and thats the domain that it was changing)

will want to configure changeOpenLDAPPwd.config.php to suit your needs

whatever user you update it changes the following
  sambaNTPassword
  sambaLMPassword
  sambaPwdLastSet
  sambaPwdMustChange

  userPassword
  shadowLastChange

note that it creates a SSHA1 hash for userPassword


New files from me:
  changeOpenLDAPPwd.class.php
  changeOpenLDAPPwd.config.php
  changeOpenLDAPPwd.validate.php
  csLogging.class.php
  sambahash.php

Added but borrowed:
  passwordrules.js

Modified from original plugin:
  password.js
  password.php
